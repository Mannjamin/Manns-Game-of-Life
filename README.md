This project took over two and a half weeks to develop.
The Java File consists of over 1000 lines of code.

## Future Improvements
In the furture I intend to add multiple features including:
* More Game Of Life Based Anomalys / Patterns.
* The Ability to Change Interface Colors.
* Toggle Between Square and Cirlce Cells.
* Improve Statistical Data Gathering and Displayment.
* Add Support for Textual Changes to the Central Image Array.
* Add Support for Textual Formatting to the Central Image Array.
* Develop and Alive Duration showcase (Change Color based on how long a cell has been alive)
* Implement an ability to save the current generation as an image.
* Implement an ability to change the size of cells.
